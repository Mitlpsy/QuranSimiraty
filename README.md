## Knime - Similarity translator Surah (Al-Fatihah)

# Overview
  * This is a text mining project to verify that Surah Al-Fatihah is Al-Fatihah, find different translations and the closest percentage. by using a computer as a central     analysis this project is going to teach computers to understand more about Al-Fatihah by mining some mathematical matrix text through a no-code mining tool.

#Conclusion
 * In this project I used the tfi-df formula to generate approximate quantities to use the cosine method to measure the documented numbers of surah Al-fatihah 
 and I got the highest similarity score - 0.91.
